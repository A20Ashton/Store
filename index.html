            The most common medical reason for men having the urethra surgically <br>
            stretched is a urethral stricture. A urethral stricture occurs when the <br>
            urethra, a tube responsible for carrying urine from the bladder out <br>
            of the body, is abnormally narrowed.  Urethra is the tube that connects <br>
            the urinary bladder and the urinary meatus (external urethral orifice, <br>
            simply put, opening of urethra) so that urine can be removed from the body.
